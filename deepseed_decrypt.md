Variable Name Restoration Analysis
Based on the provided JavaScript file typora_frame.js, here's an analysis of the variables and their likely original names:

Main Variables
Module System Variables:

m - Likely global or window (passed as parameter to the outer function)

t - Likely defineProperty helper function

s - Likely wrapModule or moduleWrapper

g - Likely Module constructor

a - Likely getModule

l - Likely loadModule

c - Likely configureModule

d - Likely registerModule

u - Likely registerDynamicModule

y - Likely executeModule

h - Likely registerNodeModule

p - Likely registry or moduleRegistry

n - Likely symbolKey or hiddenKey

DOM/Editor Related:

F - Likely CodeMirror (imported from module "20")

S - Likely jQuery (imported from module "e")

k - Likely Node related utilities

E - Likely Diagram related functionality

T - Likely MathBlock related functionality

Utility Functions:

a - Likely escapeString or htmlEscape (from module "11")

M - Likely parseFenceOptions

u - Likely normalizeLanguageMode or getLanguageMode

L - Likely handleTextReplacement

Class Names
f class at the end:

This appears to be a Fences or CodeBlock class that handles code fences in the editor

Properties:

editor - Reference to main editor instance

queue - Async operation queue

cachedCharWidth - Cached character width measurement

ALL - All supported language modes

autoCompleteRender - Function to render language mode autocomplete

The code appears to be part of Typora's editor framework, handling module loading, code editing functionality (via CodeMirror), and special block types like code fences, diagrams, and math blocks.

The minification has shortened all variable names, but the structure suggests this is part of a larger modular system where different editor components are loaded and managed.

Would you like me to analyze any specific part of this code in more detail?
